                Pyrsia is a collaboration of leading companies in the software industry. As a prospective project of the OpenSSF we are building on decades of
                experience developing, deploying and securing code pipelines. With companies like JFrog supporting this project, we are leveraging our
                knowledge of package management, integration with central repositories, and the requirements of building with open-source communities.

              <p>
                The open-source supply chain has become a critical element in nearly every technology, from the operating system and browser you are using
                to the applications and services we depend on to run our lives. Innovations
                like the <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8982/meet-the-open-source-software-powering-nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter/">NASA Mars Rovers</a> might
                not have been possible without the open source communities and the powerful technologies they have created.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet in recent years this has become a vulnerability that has been exploited to inject malicious malware or viruses that infect vast numbers
                of companies and services. In rare cases it has been highly regarded packages that have been compromised by their authors. What halts developers
                around the world is the <b>downtime and outages of the central repositories</b> that cripples continuous integration and delivery pipelines.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pyrsia provides unmatched simplicity, agility and choice by empowering develoeprs app development. We can simplify and accelerate development
                workflows with our integrated dev pipeline which enables secure distribution of packages.
